    # XXX: add repos here too, that requires some churn, see
    # https://github.com/osbuild/images/compare/main...mvo5:yaml-distroconfig?expand=1
    # and we will also need to think about backward compat, as currently
    # dropping "$distro-$ver.json" files into
    # /etc/osbuild-composer/repositories will define what distros are
    # available via images and we will need to provide compatibility for
    # that.
    #
    # Having the repos separated means when a new fedora release is out
    # we will need to update two places which is clearly a regression from
    # before.
