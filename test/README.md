# osbuild/images testing information

`./test/configs/` contains configuration files for building images for testing. The files are used by the following tools:

- `./cmd/build` takes a config file as argument to build an image.  For example:
```
sudo go run ./cmd/build -output ./buildtest -rpmmd /tmp/rpmmd -distro fedora-38 -image qcow2 -config test/configs/embed-containers.json
```
will build a Fedora 38 qcow2 image using the configuration specified in the file `embed-containers.json`

- `./cmd/gen-manifests` generates manifests based on the configs specified in `./test/config-map.json`. The config map maps configuration files to image types, distributions, and architectures.  An empty list means it applies to all values.  Globs are supported.

The config map is also used in CI to dynamically generate test builds using the `./test/cases/generate-build-config` scripts.
