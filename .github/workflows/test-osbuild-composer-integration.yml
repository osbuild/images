# PLEASE UPDATE THIS COMMENT IF ANY RELEVANT CHANGES ARE MADE TO THE WORKFLOW
#
# This workflow tests if an open PR breaks osbuild-composer's compatibility
# with images. If it does, it posts a message on the PR itself notifying the
# author and reviewers of this change. The workflow works as follows:
#
# 1. Checks out osbuild/osbuild-composer
# 2. Replaces the osbuild/images dependency with the base of the PR (this is
#    the HEAD of main at the time the PR was opened or updated) and runs
#    osbuild-composer's unit tests.
# 3. If the unit tests on the base (step 2) succeed, replaces the
#    osbuild/images dependency with the *HEAD* of the open PR and runs
#    osbuild-composer's unit tests. If the tests on the base failed, no further
#    action is taken.
# 4. At most one of two messages is posted:
# 4.1 Posts a message on the open PR only if the unit tests with the base (step
#     2) succeed and the unit tests with the PR HEAD (step 3) fail. This
#     combination of outcomes indicates that the PR is the one responsible for
#     the breakage.
# 4.2 Updates the existing message on the open PR only if the unit tests with
#     the base (step2) succeed, the unit tests with the PR HEAD (step 3)
#     succeed, and there is already a message posted by this workflow. This is
#     meant for cases where a PR initially breaks compatibility and then it gets
#     fixed. No message should be posted on a PR that doesn't affect the
#     integration tests.
#
# Limitations:
# 1. This workflow runs on pull_request_target, which means it runs on the main
#    branch. Changes to this workflow in a PR will not affect the run for that
#    PR. Running on pull_request_target is needed to have access to repository
#    secrets (Schutzbot's GitHub token).
# 2. If the unit tests in this repository fail, the integration will fail and
#    the message will be posted (if the integration is not also failing on
#    main). This will happen even if there's no actual integration issue, so
#    the message can be misleading. However, subsequent runs that fix the issue
#    will update the message accordingly.

            This PR changes the images API or behaviour causing integration failures with osbuild-composer. The next update of the images dependency in osbuild-composer will need work to adapt to these changes.

            This is simply a notice. It will not block this PR from being merged.
